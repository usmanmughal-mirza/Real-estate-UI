        para:"A MyHome salesperson is more than just a “sales person.” They act on your behalf as your agent, providing you with advice and guidance and doing a job – helping you buy or sell a home. While it is true they get paid for what they do, so do other professions that provide advice, guidance."

        para:"The answer to the question is YES! There are tons of reasons why you should talk with a bank and get pre-approved before looking at homes. First and foremost, talking with a bank before looking at homes can help you understand exactly how much you can afford. There is no reason to look at homes that are listed for $250,000 if you can only afford up to $200,000."

        para:"Buying a home can be a very solid investment. This being said, renting can also be a better option for some, depending on the circumstances. The current interest rates are incredible. A 30-year FHA mortgage can be locked in at a rate of around 3.5%. Since the interest rates are so low, it actually can be cheaper to pay a mortgage right now than paying rent."

        para:"Of course you can, but the probability isn’t very high. The same can be said about a rent-to-own property. A common question from home buyers is whether rent-to-owns exist or whether an owner would consider that option. They are out there, but there are somethings that you need to know before agreeing to a rent-to-own."
